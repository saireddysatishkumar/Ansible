scenario 2:

Attached is a repository named: RHEV that was cloned from github. It contains a playbook called "maint.yml"
that we use to execute OS related functions across our existing server fleet. Normally, this playbook is executed 
on our AWX server which provides a UI to ease the user of running Ansible through the command line. Today, our
AWX server is down so this playbook must be ran locally.

Enclosed in (scenario2).zip file:
- RHEV (maint.yml playbook)
- hostfile
- config.yml


task:
- Read through the playbook to get an understanding
- Assume the last step performed is `git clone`
- provide the CLI commands to setup your ansible environment and execute only the `antivirus_agent` and `monitor_agent` roles using the `maint.yml` playbook on 10.2.2.16, 10.5.5.39, 10.5.5.53, and 10.6.6.53.



requirements:
- provide the CLI commands to perform the task without altering any files
- include all supporting commands
- provide an explanation on your thought process
